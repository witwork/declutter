### FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Is Declutter safe to use?</strong></summary>

Yes! Declutter never permanently deletes files. All deletions are moved to Trash, where you can recover them if needed. We also skip system files and protected directories.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why does Declutter need Full Disk Access?</strong></summary>

Full Disk Access allows Declutter to scan all your files, including those in protected locations like Desktop and Documents. Without it, many duplicates would be missed.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is AI Scene Matching different from Similar Images?</strong></summary>

Similar Images uses perceptual hashing to find visually similar images (same photo, different sizes). AI Scene Matching uses Apple's Vision framework to understand the content of images and find different photos of the same subject or location.
</details>

## Use Cases

### Find Duplicate Files on Mac
Scan your entire Mac or specific folders to find exact byte-for-byte duplicate files. Perfect for cleaning up Downloads, Documents, or external drives.

### Remove Duplicate Photos
Have thousands of photos taking up space? Declutter finds duplicate and similar photos across your photo library, even if they've been resized or compressed.

### Clean Up Mac Storage
Running out of disk space? Use the Large Files finder to identify what's taking up the most space, and the Cache Cleaner to safely remove temporary files.

### Organize Photo Library
The AI Scene Matching feature helps you find multiple photos of the same subject or location - perfect for cleaning up after vacations or events.
